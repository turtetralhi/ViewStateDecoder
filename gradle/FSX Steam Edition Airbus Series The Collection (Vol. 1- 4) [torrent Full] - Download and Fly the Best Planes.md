All these add-ons are developed by FeelThere, a team of highly qualified programmers and active professional pilots who have created some of the most realistic and immersive flight simulation products on the market. These add-ons are compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition, which is a re-release of the popular flight simulator game with enhanced graphics, multiplayer support and Steam integration.
 
What makes these add-ons stand out is their detailed depiction of the fascinating world of Fly-By-Wire technology as well as the Airbus' high-end systems. Fly-By-Wire is a system that replaces conventional mechanical flight controls with electronic signals that are transmitted by wires and interpreted by computers. This allows for more precise and efficient control of the aircraft, as well as enhanced safety features and reduced weight and maintenance costs. The Airbus' high-end systems include simulations of all on-board systems, such as hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, fuel, air conditioning, fire protection, ice protection, anti-skid brakes, landing gear and more. These systems are controlled by a complete and ultra-realistic flight computer that allows for various modes of operation, such as normal law, alternate law, direct law and mechanical backup.
 
These add-ons also feature realistic flight dynamics that are based on manufacturer's specifications and tested by different active Airbus pilots and instructors. The aircraft behave exactly as the real ones in terms of performance, handling and fuel consumption. The add-ons also feature flexible wings that bend according to the aerodynamic load, detailed interior views with animated pilots and passengers, realistic sound effects that vary according to engine type and throttle position, numerous animations such as hydraulic suspension, flaps, slats, spoilerons, speed brakes, thrust reversers, landing gear, passenger's door and cargo hatches.
 
The add-ons also feature a glass cockpit with advanced digital avionics that are certified for CAT II and III landing operations. The cockpit features interactive 3D virtual instruments that can be controlled from either the Captain or First Officer's seat. The cockpit also features a Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) that alerts the pilot of potential terrain conflicts or excessive descent rates, as well as caution messages that indicate any system failures or malfunctions. The cockpit also features a Radio Management panel that allows for easy tuning of navigation and communication frequencies. The cockpit also features hotspots on the panel that ease access to 2D panels such as overhead panel, pedestal panel or throttle quadrant panel. The cockpit also features pop up EFIS screens that can be resized and detached for any additional monitor use.
