If you want to use Windows 7 without activating it, you can use a tool called InfiniteRearm4. This tool can reset the rearm count of Windows 7, which is the number of times you can extend the trial period of Windows 7 by 30 days. By default, you can only rearm Windows 7 three times, which gives you a total of 120 days of free usage. But with InfiniteRearm4, you can rearm Windows 7 indefinitely, which means you can use Windows 7 forever without cracking it.
 
InfiniteRearm4 is one of the three tools that can reset the rearm count of Windows 7. The other two are Windows 7 Rearm Forever 2.0 and Windows 7 RearmTask4 v2.1. All these tools work by deleting a registry key called WPA, which contains the last rearm time information. This registry key cannot be accessed from within Windows, so you need to boot into the Windows Recovery Environment or the Windows Pre-installation Environment to run these tools.

You can now use Windows 7 for another 30 days without activation. You can repeat this process every month to keep using Windows 7 forever without cracking it. However, this method is not recommended for long-term use as it may cause some issues with updates and security. It is better to activate your Windows 7 with a genuine product key or use a free alternative operating system like Linux.
  
However, using Windows 7 without activation has some drawbacks. You will not be able to receive any updates from Microsoft, which means your system will be vulnerable to security risks and bugs. You will also see a watermark on the bottom-right corner of your screen that says âThis copy of Windows is not genuineâ. You will also get frequent reminders to activate your copy of Windows 7.
 
Therefore, it is recommended that you activate your copy of Windows 7 as soon as possible. Activating Windows 7 has many benefits, such as:

- You will have access to all the features and functions of Windows 7, depending on the edition you have. For example, Windows 7 Professional has more features than Windows 7 Home Premium, such as Remote Desktop Server, Encrypted File System, and Software Restriction Policy.[^3^]
- You will be able to download and install updates from Microsoft, which will keep your system secure and stable. Updates can also improve the performance and compatibility of your system.[^4^]
- You will be able to use media files that require validation, such as Windows Media Center and Windows Media Player.[^2^]
- You will be able to activate trial versions of Windows 7 into full versions for free via Microsoftâs assistive technologies activation site here: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows10upgrade](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows10upgrade).

- You will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 for free if you have a genuine copy of Windows 7. Windows 10 is the latest version of Windows that has many new features and improvements over Windows 7.[^4^]

To activate your copy of Windows 7, you will need a valid product key that matches the edition of Windows 7 you have installed. You can find your product key on the sticker underneath your laptop, on the back of your computer case, on the disc case for your Windows 7 installation DVD, or in the Windows 7 manual. If you downloaded the software online, then you will find it in your confirmation email. If you have a Microsoft account, the key may be listed in your account details when you log in.[^1^]
 
If you have lost or misplaced your product key, you may need to purchase a new one from Microsoft or an authorized retailer. You can also use a third-party tool to recover your product key from your system registry. However, this is not recommended as it may violate the terms and conditions of Microsoft.[^1^]
