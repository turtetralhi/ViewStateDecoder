## Step 2: Draw or Import an Image for Your Icon
 
Once you choose a project size, you will see a blank canvas where you can draw your icon using various tools such as pencil, brush, eraser, fill, line, rectangle, ellipse, etc. You can also adjust the color and opacity of your icon. Alternatively, you can import an image from your computer or from other sources such as DLL and executable files. You can also use JPG, GIF, and BMP images as input files and save them as icon files. For this example, we will import an image of a star from our computer.
 
## Step 3: Apply Effects and Filters to Your Icon
 
After you import or draw your icon, you can apply various effects and filters to enhance its appearance. You can access these options from the Effects menu. Some of the effects and filters include soften, darken, lighten, emboss, blur, sharpen, gray scale, negative, rotate, flip, etc. For this example, we will apply a yellow color filter and an emboss effect to our star icon.
 
## Step 4: Save and Export Your Icon
 
When you are satisfied with your icon design, you can save it as an ICO file by clicking on the Save button on the toolbar. You can also export your icon as other formats such as PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP and JPG by clicking on the Export button on the toolbar. You can then use your icon for your desktop or website as you wish.
